# tile-planner

Client side app to plan tiling under a circural pool.

This is my first time using Canvas. Code is pretty dirty. Made this app so I can optimise the number of 40x60 cm cements tiles used under a circural pool having the diameter of 300 cm.

You can drag and drop the grey tiles with left mouse. Rotate with right mouse and spawn new tiles with the spacebar.
